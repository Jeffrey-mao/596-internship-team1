This repository is for internship team 1 

<h4>There are some key points we've decided:</h4>
1. We decided to use VUE2 and mock.js to develop this front-end program <br>
2. We will develop two pages, One is a quiz page like  quiz-page on Moodle and has the same function as well. The other one is the report page, it looks
   like the same as your picture. We'll develop the function as follows:<br>
   1)Log-need to track users step to action<br>
   2)It can export as PDF fomat<br>
   ***3)Visually track user behaviour*** Just do our best if time is enough.<br>
3. We'll set up our environment in these two days, and spend a week learning about VUE2 and mock.js as well as start coding from week 3.<br>

<h3> The above is only the initial plan and it could be changed when we are pushing the whole process </h3><br>
